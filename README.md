# HR-ANALYTICS-INSIGHTS-DASHBOARD
My client Atliq Technologies wanted me to build a Data Analytics Dashboard using Power BI to automate the working of HR. The analysis is done on various parameters to give a proper insights into the requirements mentioned by HR.


🚀Requirements of HR:-

⭐️ Working preferences of employees between Work From Home and Work From Office.

⭐️ Percentage of overall sick leave to monitor employee wellness.

⭐️ The reason behind the choice of work from home frequently.

And most importantly learning the power BI basics through this project.


🚀# Benefits:-

⭐️If she gets these insights from the data then she can plan some team-building activities or team lunches.

⭐️The other benefit of getting these insights, just that if the company is going for the Hybrid Model ( Ex- WFH 2 days, WFO 3 days) working then she can do better capacity planning.

⭐️Also, the company can use better utilization of space and saves some money on infrastructure after getting these types of insights.


﻿🚀# About The Dashboard:-
